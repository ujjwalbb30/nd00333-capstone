        "(2) max_concurrent_iterations : It is the maximum number of iterations to be executed in parallel. I will input it as '5' iterations. 5 concurrent iterations will help in quickly executing the tasks of experiment and it will also not load the compute target too much for computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "(3) primary_metric : This is the metric that will be optimized by Automated Machine Learning for model selection. I will use 'AUC_weighted' as 'primary_metric' parameter. AUC means the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve which plots the relationship between true positive rate and false positive rate. Since our dataset doesn't have high class imbalance, we can use ROC method for judging the performance of a model. I will use AUC_weighted in order to mitigate the effects of whatever little imbalance is there in the dataset. AUC_weighted is the arithmetic mean of the score for each class, weighted by the number of true instances in each class.\n",

        "\n",
        "(2) task : I want to make a classification model that can predict whether the patient is at a high risk of cardiovascular disease or not. Hence, I will input 'classification' as 'task' parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "(3) training_data : It is the training dataset to be used for the experiment. I will use 'dataset' (the registered dataset imported above for running this experiment) as 'training_data' parameter. importing training dataset means the output columns will be included and its name will be entered in 'label_column_name'.\n",
        "\n",
        "(4) label_column_name : It is the name of the output column present in the training dataset. I will enter 'DEATH_EVENT' as 'label_column_name' parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "(5) path : This is the full path to the Azure Machine learning project folder. Hence, I will input './pipeline-project' as 'path' parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "(6) enable_early_stopping : we can choose to terminate the experiment if the score stops improving in the short term. I will enter 'True' as 'enable_early_stopping' parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "(7) featurization : It is the option to featurize the dataset i.e. whether we want the Azure to do it automatically or we want to turn it off or we want some customized featurization step. I will input 'auto' in the 'featurization' parameter as I want Azure to featurize the dataset automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "(8) debug_log : it is the log file in which debug information is written. I am entering 'automl_errors.log' as 'debug_log' parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "(9) n_cross_validations : It is the number of cross validations performed. I will input it as '5' since the input rows is way lower than 1000 and 5 cross validations will not be very computation expensive."
